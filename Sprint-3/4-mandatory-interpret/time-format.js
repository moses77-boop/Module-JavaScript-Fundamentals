// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
// The 'pad' function is called "three times" within the 'formatTimeDisplay' function
// The count will always be three because the 'return' statement contains three 'pad()' calls 

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// for the first call to pad, num is assigned the value of 'totalHours', which is '0'
// Since the template literal is evaluated from left to right, calling 'formatTimeDisplay(61)', the calls occur in this order:
// totalHours, remainingMinutes, and remainingSeconds

// c) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// For the first call to 'pad', 'num' is '0'
// The pad function will return '00' because it pads single-digit numbers with a leading zero

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The last call is 'pad(remainingSeconds)' which is '61 % 60'
// since 61 divided by 60 leaves a remainder of 1, it means the value '1' is assigned to 'num' in the last call of pad

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The return value of pad when called for the last time is '01'
// since '1.toString()' is '1', the 'while' loop runs once and adds a '0' to the front, giving '01'
